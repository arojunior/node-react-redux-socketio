# Node + React + Redux + Socket.io

Some experiments with React and Socket.io working together

### Start client (port 3000)
```shell
cd client && npm start
```

### Start server (port 3001)
```shell
cd server && npm start
```

The client opens a browser window automatically, and then you can open another one in the /manager route to see socket.io working when you click alarm button
